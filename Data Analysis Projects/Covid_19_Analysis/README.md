# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python

### 🎯 Project Overview
This project analyzes the global COVID-19 dataset to explore infection trends, mortality rates, and testing statistics using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
It demonstrates how to handle large real-world datasets, clean missing values, and visualize key insights effectively.

### 📂 Files in this Project
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `covid_19_dat_aanalysis.py` | Main Python script for data analysis and visualization |
| `compact.csv` | Dataset containing worldwide COVID-19 data (country-wise and date-wise) |

### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Reading large CSV files with **Pandas**
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Summarizing data with `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Selecting specific columns and filtering by conditions
- Grouping and aggregating data (e.g., by country or continent)
- Sorting and finding top statistics
- Visualizing trends using **Matplotlib** (line plots, bar charts)

**📊 Dataset:
This project uses the COVID-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data).  
Due to GitHub file size limits, the original dataset (`compact.csv`) is not included here.  
You can download it manually and place it in the same folder before running the script.
