# 🧮 Sales Data Dashboard (Python + Pandas + Matplotlib)

## 📘 Overview
This project is an **interactive data analysis dashboard** built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
It analyzes a sales dataset to find **total revenue, sales trends, and category-wise performance**,  
and presents them both in text summaries and visual charts.

This project demonstrates real-world data analysis skills — similar to what analysts do in business or e-commerce companies.
