# ðŸ’¸ Personal Expense Tracker (File Handling Project)

This project is a simple **Expense Tracker** built using Python and file handling concepts.  
It allows users to record, view, and manage daily expenses â€” all stored permanently in a text file.


## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Use **file handling** in Python (`open`, `read`, `write`, `append`)
- Store data persistently even after the program closes
- Read and process data from text files
- Build a menu-based console application



## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Add new expenses (date, category, amount, description)  
âœ… View all recorded expenses  
âœ… Calculate total amount spent  
âœ… Search expenses by category  
âœ… Save all data automatically in a text file (`expenses.txt`)



## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- File handling (`open()`, `with` statement)
- Loops and conditionals
- Lists and string manipulation (`split()`, `join()`)
- Error handling using `try-except`
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes and methods)



## ðŸ“‚ File Details

- **`expense_tracker.py`** â†’ Main Python script  
- **`expenses.txt`** â†’ Automatically created file to store all expense records  

Each record in `expenses.txt` looks like this:

Date,Category,Amount,Description
25-10-2025,Food,250,Lunch with friends
