# 🧠 Logic Fundamentals – Python Mini Projects

This folder contains beginner to medium-level Python projects that helped me improve my logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and understanding of core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and user input.

## 📁 List of Projects

### 🧮 1. Simple Calculator (`simple_calculator.py`)
A basic calculator program that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**🧠 Concepts Used:**
- Functions  
- Conditionals (`if-elif-else`)  
- User input and type conversion  


### ✊✋✌️ 2. Rock Paper Scissors Game (`rps_game.py`)

A fun command-line game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer randomly chooses one of the options, and you compete to win.

**🧠 Concepts Used:**

* `random` module
* Loops and conditionals
* User input and logic comparison



### 🎯 3. Random Number Guesser (`random_number_guesser.py`)

The computer picks a random number, and the player tries to guess it. It gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low until you find the correct number.

**🧠 Concepts Used:**

* `random` module
* While loops
* Conditional logic


### 📝 4. To-Do List App (`To_Do_List.py`)

A simple command-line to-do list application where you can add, view, and remove tasks. It helps you practice working with lists and file handling.

**🧠 Concepts Used:**

* Lists and loops
* File handling (`open`, `write`, `read`)
* Functions and user menus



### ❓ 5. Simple Quiz Game (`simplequiz_game.py`)

A text-based quiz game where you answer multiple-choice questions and get a final score at the end.

**🧠 Concepts Used:**

* Dictionaries for question storage
* Loops and conditionals
* Score tracking and user input

**▶️ How to Run:**



## 🧩 Learning Outcomes

By working on these projects, I learned:

* How to take and validate user input
* The importance of loops and conditional statements
* How to organize programs using functions
* Implementing randomness in games
* Basic file handling and data management
