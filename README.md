# 🐍 Python Projects

A curated collection of my Python projects — from foundational exercises to applied data science and object-oriented applications.

This repository documents my learning journey in Python programming and analytics.  
It begins with small, logic-based programs that build core problem-solving skills, and gradually expands into projects involving **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **object-oriented design**.

Each project reflects progress toward writing clean, modular, and well-documented code — skills essential for real-world software and data-driven problem solving.

## 🚀 Key Focus Areas

- **Core Python Concepts:** conditionals, loops, functions, and user input  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** classes, objects, encapsulation, and modular code  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** exploring datasets with `pandas` and `matplotlib`  
- **Practical Applications:** small systems, automation scripts, and analytics projects  
- **Future Expansion:** machine learning, API integration, and full data-driven applications



## 💡 Purpose

To demonstrate consistent learning, problem-solving ability, and readiness to build scalable, data-driven, and real-world applications using Python.
